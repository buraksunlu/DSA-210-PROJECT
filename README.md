# DSA-210-PROJECT

# Introduction 
The aim of this project is to analyze whether games with Turkish language support on Steam are purchased and preferred more by the Turkish gaming community compared to similar games that lack Turkish language support.  

# Hypothesis
Games that offer Turkish language support on Steam are more likely to be purchased and preferred by Turkish players than similar games that do not provide Turkish language support. I believe that language accessibility plays a significant role in game selection among Turkish gamers.  

# Motivation  
I have observed that many games on Steam lack Turkish language support, yet Turkish players often request localization. This project aims to understand whether language support directly affects purchasing behavior. The findings may highlight the importance of localization for developers targeting the Turkish gaming community.  

# Data Source 
I will collect data from Steam, including sales figures, user reviews, and community discussions. I will compare the sales and popularity of games with and without Turkish language support within the same genre. Since all the data will be publicly available on Steam, there should be no ethical or privacy concerns.  

# Project Plan 
- Identify and list games with and without Turkish language support in specific genres.  
- Collect relevant data such as sales numbers, user reviews, and ratings.  
- Analyze the data using charts and descriptive statistics to compare trends.  
- Test the hypothesis by evaluating whether Turkish-supported games have a higher purchase rate and preference among Turkish players.  
- Draw conclusions on the impact of Turkish language support on game sales and player choices.
